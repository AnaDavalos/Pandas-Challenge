    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*     Point #1 - Charter Schools had overall higher Math and Reading academic averages than District Schools. Analysis proves the overall percentage passing rate (based upon the average of the math and reading passing rates), was appr. 95% for Charter Schools and appr. 73% for District Schools. Thus, although charter schools have overall better passing rates than district schools and have overall smaller student body sizes, distinguishing amongst small and medium sized charter schools the level of achievement in math/reading based upon the student body size would not yield valuable a conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*     Point #2 - Schools with a greater amount of dollars available for spending did not significantly out-perform schools with less.\n",
    "\n",
    "*     Point #3 - Based upon the breakdown of math scores by grade for each high school, it is observed that the math averages for each school do not vary a significant amount from grade level to grade level. \n",
    "There is a noticeable difference in the range for the averages between math and reading. For math, there are six high schools with C-average scores for math, Rodriguez High School with the approximately the lowest averages. However, the lowest reading averages do not trend below a score of 80. Although for certain high schools the math average was not significantly different from the reading averages, for those high schools which scored a C-average in math â€“ their corresponding reading scores were noticeably higher and sat in the B-range. Overall, it can be observed that the reading average was consistently higher than the math average for each institution."
